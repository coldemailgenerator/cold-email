âœ… Final Prompt for Replit AI:
You are upgrading a full Flask-based SaaS projectâ€™s front-end. All HTML files are stored in the templates/ folder, and CSS/JS in static/.

ðŸŽ¯ Your job is to apply the Cold Email Generator Landing Page Theme consistently across ALL pages, making them modern, responsive, and professional.

ðŸ§© Apply this Theme to:
landing.html

login.html

signup.html

home.html (dashboard showing emails)

profile.html

archived.html

locked.html

set_lock_password.html

verify_lock_password.html

ðŸŽ¨ Design Requirements:
Use Cold Email Generator Theme (already built in landing.html)

Primary color: #1034A6

Font: Poppins, fallback Inter

White background with dark text (unless dark mode)

Rounded corners, hover animations, subtle shadows

Responsive & Consistent Layout

Use layout.html (Jinja template) for base structure

All pages should {% extends 'layout.html' %} and {% block content %} their content

Use consistent navbars, footers, cards, buttons, form fields

Fix Visual Issues

Navbar: must change colors properly in dark mode (not stay white)

All text (especially .description, .eg, inputs) should be readable in both modes

Add smooth transitions for hover and dark toggle

Functionality Fixes

Profile Page:

Show total email count, archived count, locked count

Add working buttons for "Change Password", "Upgrade Plan", "Logout"

Locked & Set Password Pages:

Center forms, fix bland UI

Add working "Reset Lock Password" button

Modern Touches

Add scroll animations (e.g., AOS.js or fade-ins)

Use Flexbox/Grid for layouts

Ensure mobile-first responsiveness

Add hover glow or ripple effects to buttons

âœ… Output:
Replace all existing HTML files inside /templates/ with upgraded versions

Create or update layout.html in /templates/

Place CSS in /static/style.css and link it in all pages

JS (like dark mode toggle, form interactivity) goes in /static/script.js

ðŸ’¡ You donâ€™t need to add Flask back-end code. Just front-end HTML/CSS/JS.

This is your final task â€” make the site look professional, responsive, clean, and ready for launch with no flaws.
